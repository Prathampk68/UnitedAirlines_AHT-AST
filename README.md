Title:
Optimizing Call Center Efficiency at United Airlines through Enhanced IVR Systems and Data-Driven Solutions

Project Description:

This project aims to optimize the call center operations at United Airlines by improving key performance metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). 
The project focuses on identifying common call issues and analyzing call center data to uncover inefficiencies. By leveraging data-driven insights, we propose enhancements to the IVR
(Interactive Voice Response) system to handle routine queries such as flight status, seating, booking changes, and Mileage Plus inquiries.
The project will explore patterns in call reasons, agent performance, customer sentiments, and peak call periods to pinpoint the drivers of prolonged call durations.
Recommendations will be made to streamline processes, reduce agent intervention, and enhance self-service options. Additionally, sentiment and silence analysis will be used to further
optimize IVR flows and reduce AHT during high-call traffic periods. The overall objective is to improve operational efficiency, reduce customer wait times, and enhance customer 
satisfaction by automating and personalizing service through advanced IVR solutions.
